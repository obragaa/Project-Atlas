# Atlas — System Architecture

> This document is the consolidated, living model of the Atlas system. It is
> derived entirely from `/blueprint` (the source of truth) and records how the
> Blueprint is being realized. It evolves with the code (blueprint/23).

## System shape

Atlas is a monorepo (ADR-0001) with a clear separation between the experience
(web), the domain (api), and the shared contracts and design language.

## Backend layering (blueprint/12)

Each domain module under `apps/api/src/modules/<domain>` is internally layered;
dependencies point inward and the Domain layer is framework/DB-agnostic.

```text
presentation/   controllers, DTOs, guards, decorators  (knows HTTP)
application/    use cases — the business rules          (knows ports)
domain/         entities, value objects, events, ports  (knows nothing external)
infrastructure/ adapters implementing the ports         (knows the world)
```

The shared kernel (`apps/api/src/shared/domain`) provides framework-free
primitives: `Identifier`, `Entity`, `AggregateRoot`, `ValueObject`,
`DomainEvent`, and the `DomainError` hierarchy that maps to the API error
taxonomy.

Cross-cutting concerns (`apps/api/src/shared/http`, `config`): correlation IDs,
the RFC 7807 exception filter, validation→422 mapping, structured logging
(pino) with secret redaction, and validated environment config (zod, fail-fast).

The shared kernel also owns two cross-cutting infrastructure seams used by every
domain module (`apps/api/src/shared`, wired by the global `SharedKernelModule`):

- **Domain-event dispatch** (`DOMAIN_EVENT_PUBLISHER`): use cases publish an
  aggregate's recorded events after persistence; an in-process synchronous
  dispatcher invokes handlers, isolating handler failures from the business
  flow (blueprint/12, 13). `UserRegistered` now actually fires.
- **Audit channel** (`AUDIT_LOGGER`): a dedicated, append-only structured-log
  channel (`channel: "audit"`) distinct from technical logs, recording
  security-relevant facts — register, login (success/failure), token refresh,
  logout, and session revocation on reuse detection (blueprint/15 "Audit Trail",
  21 fourth pillar). Entries carry stable ids only — never passwords or raw
  tokens.

## What is implemented (Phase 1 — Foundation)

| Area                                                                  | Status                    |

| CI quality gates, API Dockerfile, local infra compose                 | ✅                        |

## What is implemented (Phase 2 — Persistence & Sessions)

| Area                                                                      | Status                   |

| Domain-event dispatch + audit channel (register/login/refresh/logout)     | ✅                       |

## What is implemented (Phase 3 — Core experience, in progress)

The first business domain after auth. The Core dashboard aggregates these
domains, so they come first (ADR-0003).

| Area                                                                            | Status              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Workouts domain: `Workout` aggregate → items → sets, value objects, events      | ✅ (unit-tested)    |
| Workouts use cases: create/get/list/update/delete/complete/duplicate            | ✅                  |
| Workouts persistence: Drizzle tables + migration `0001`, `PostgresWorkoutRepo`  | ✅ (PGlite integ.)  |
| Workouts API: contract-first, RFC 7807, cursor pagination, ownership 404        | ✅ (flow-verified)  |
| `WorkoutCompleted` event → audit channel                                        | ✅ (flow-verified)  |
| Web: `/workouts` board (list/create/complete/duplicate/delete) via the contract | ✅ (build-verified) |

The shared `@atlas/contracts` package now **builds to `dist`** (CJS + d.ts):
once the API consumes a runtime _value_ from it (e.g. `LOAD_UNITS`), the package
must be loadable at runtime, not just at type-check. `turbo`'s `^build` ordering
builds it before its consumers.

### Resolved (were Phase 1 tracked exceptions)

- **In-memory `UserRepository`** → resolved by `PostgresUserRepository`
  (PostgreSQL + Drizzle, doc 13); the in-memory `FakeUserRepository` is now a
  test-only fixture.
- **Stateless logout / no refresh-token store** → resolved by the Redis-backed
  `SessionStore` with current-hash refresh rotation, reuse detection, and
  family-wide revocation; logout revokes server-side immediately.

### Tracked exceptions (blueprint/23)

- **In-memory adapters for tests/local** — `InMemorySessionStore` and
  `InMemoryCache` mirror the Redis adapters' semantics so the app runs without
  Redis (`SESSION_DRIVER=memory`, PGlite database). Single-process only;
  production uses the Redis adapters. _Owner: backend._
- **In-process event dispatch (no durable outbox)** — domain events dispatch
  synchronously in-process; a crash between persistence and dispatch can drop an
  event. A transactional outbox is deferred until a module needs cross-service
  delivery guarantees (doc 13).
- **Audit channel is log-based (no tamper-evident store)** — audit entries flow
  to a dedicated structured-log channel, not yet to immutable, append-only
  storage with its own retention (doc 15 "auditoria imutável", 21 retention).
- **No circuit breakers** on backing-service calls (doc 17) — timeouts and
  bounded reconnect exist; breakers are deferred.
- **No MFA / account lockout** (doc 15) — the architecture is prepared (risk
  level on sessions, device ids) but TOTP/passkeys and progressive lockout are
  not implemented.
- **Risk scoring seeded as `low`** — the session risk-analysis engine
  (suspicious-activity detection, doc 15) is deferred; sessions record a risk
  level but it is not yet computed.
- **No backup / retention policy** wired for Postgres/Redis (docs 13, 20).

## Roadmap (derived from the Blueprint)

- **Phase 2 — Persistence & sessions:** ✅ delivered — PostgreSQL + Drizzle
  adapters, migrations (doc 13), Redis-backed sessions + refresh-token
  rotation/revocation (doc 15), readiness probe checks dependencies, audit
  channel and domain-event dispatch.
- **Phase 3 — Core experience (in progress):** Workouts ✅ (ADR-0003) as the
  first domain module; next the Core dashboard (docs 03/07), Exercises, Progress,
  and Missions/Gamification (doc 09) — then the Core aggregates them.
- **Phase 4 — Atlas AI:** the AI Gateway, Context/Prompt/Tool engines, prompt
  registry, guardrails, observability (docs 10/22).
- **Phase 5 — Observability & delivery hardening:** OpenTelemetry traces/metrics
  (doc 21), dashboards, runbooks, progressive delivery (doc 19).
